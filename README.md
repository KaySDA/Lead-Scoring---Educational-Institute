# Lead-Scoring---Educational-Institute

X Education, an online education company, wants to identify the most potential leads, or "hot leads," so that they can focus their sales efforts on those leads and improve their lead conversion rate.

Currently, X Education has a lead conversion rate of around 30%, meaning that only 30 out of every 100 leads convert into paying customers. The company wants to increase this conversion rate to around 80% by identifying and nurturing hot leads.

To help X Education identify hot leads, you have been tasked with building a model that will assign a lead score to each lead. The lead score will be based on various factors, such as the lead's demographics, interests, and behavior on X Education's website. Leads with higher lead scores will be considered more likely to convert into paying customers.
